# Healthcare-Member-Insights-DashboardHealthcare Member Insights Dashboard
**Project Overview**

This project aims to provide real-time insights into healthcare member demographics, claims, and engagement metrics using an interactive Tableau dashboard. 
By analyzing claims and membership data, the project identifies trends, monitors service utilization, and enables healthcare stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

**Objectives**

Develop a dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:
Claims trends (monthly/yearly)
Service utilization rates
Member retention and distribution by plan type
Analyze member demographics to uncover actionable insights.
Improve member engagement and healthcare service quality through data-driven strategies.

**Features**

Claims Analysis: Breakdown of claims by service type and total claim amount.
Demographics Insights: Distribution of members by age, gender, and plan type.
Engagement Metrics: Retention trends and enrollment statistics.
Trends Visualization: Monthly/yearly claims patterns and service utilization.

**Tools and Technologies**

Languages: Python, SQL
Visualization: Tableau
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Database: SQL-based systems for data extraction and transformation

**Data Description**
**Claims Data**

Simulated claims data used for analysis.

Column	Description
ClaimID	Unique ID for each claim
MemberID	Unique ID for the member
ClaimDate	Date of the claim
ServiceType	Type of service (e.g., Inpatient, Outpatient)
Amount	Claim amount in USD

**Membership Data**

Simulated member demographic data used for analysis.

Column	Description
MemberID	Unique ID for the member
Name	Member's full name
Age	Member's age in years
Gender	Member's gender
PlanType	Health insurance plan type
EnrollmentDate	Date when the member enrolled

cd Healthcare-Member-Insights-Dashboard

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install Python libraries listed in requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

Data Preparation:
Use the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook to preprocess claims and membership data.
Merge datasets and calculate KPIs.
SQL Queries:
Extract and transform data using SQL scripts in the sql_queries folder.
Dashboard:
Load the tableau_dashboard.twbx file in Tableau.
Interact with visualizations to explore insights.
Analysis:
Review trends in claims, member demographics, and engagement metrics.

**Results**

Visualized claims trends and service utilization rates.
Identified demographic patterns, such as:
High claims utilization among specific age groups.
Distribution of members across plan types.
Enabled actionable insights for improving member retention and engagement.

**Challenges**

Handling missing or incomplete data in claims and membership datasets.
Ensuring accurate calculation of KPIs across multiple dimensions.
Future Enhancements
Add predictive analytics to forecast claims and utilization.
Integrate additional datasets for deeper insights (e.g., provider data).
Automate the ETL process for real-time dashboard updates.
